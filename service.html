                    <h3>Cozby Library</h3>I collaborated with my local library, the Cozby Library, to establish a weekly test-prep workshop to help students do better on their SATs to ensure they get into good colleges. The purpose of the workshop was to provide a structured and supportive learning environment for students to learn the fundamental knowledge required to perform well on the SAT, as well as strategic test-taking skills that would give them an edge when taking their SATs. 
                    During each workshop, we focussed on a combination of core academic concepts as well as popular test-taking strategies. We covered mainly the essential math concepts: algebra I, geometry, algebra II, and pre-calculus. This was paired with proven test-taking strategies: time management, question prioritization, pacing, and elimination. We broke down the complex topics into simple concepts to help students understand the core concepts and strategies to do well on the SAT.
                    To add to this, I also co-founded a YouTube channel, Infinity Prep, which was founded to ensure accessibility and support students beyond my local community. Through the YouTube channel, we were able to reach students from all over the world. Making videos for Infinity Prep was very fun! I enjoyed the process of creating videos. The process also refined my teaching ability. 
                   Throughout the years, we were able to grow the YouTube channel to over 2,000 subscribers and over 500,000 views. This was incredible! I was overjoyed to know that we had a part in helping over 500,000 students around the world! The channel mainly featured instructional videos, practice question walkthroughs, and strategy guides to help students prepare efficiently. 
                    The experience affirmed to me my passion for education and community service. Through the weekly workshops with Cozby Library and Infinity Prep (YouTube Channel), we were able to help countless students do well on their SATs and set them up for a brighter future. Over the years, I have gotten countless messages from students that we have helped them increase their SAT scores. Knowing that I had a small part in helping the lives of students brings me great joy. </p>

                    <p>As a volunteer at the North Texas Food Bank, I contributed to their mission of providing access to nutritious meals for individuals and families in need. I assisted in sorting and packaging food items in the warehouse, ensuring that items were correctly labeled and ready for distribution. I also helped with organizing food drives, interacting with donors, and supporting community events aimed at raising awareness and funds to fight hunger.</p>
